= AsciiDoc as Plain Text
D. Day

== Setting It Up

For this to work, add `asciidoc` to the list of plain text IDs in
the settings. This will prompt for a window reload as well to make
sure the Linter is registered as a CodeActionsProvider for all the
IDs.

The Linter will treat AsciiDoc as plain text.

Need to add automated tests.

== Test Text

This is a basic AsciiDoc file. Linter should check spelling. The
Linter should also not care about word wrapping at 80.

Is speooling enabled?
