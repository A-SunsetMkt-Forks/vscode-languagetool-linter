# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

During initial development (v0.x.x), security updates are always included in minor releases
and may be included in release notes and CHANGELOG.md.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential security vulnerability please email security@davidlday.com rather 
than creating a public issue on GitHub.
